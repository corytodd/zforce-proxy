# Force Proxy

A simplified C wrapper for the zForce SDK. This library is designed to the already  awesome zForceSDK and make it easier to consume from other languages.  The zForceSDK provides software access the the IR sensor bar from Neonode called zForce Air. This library focuses exclusively on HID, not I2C mode.



### Getting Started

1. Download the latest [zForceSDK](https://support.neonode.com/docs/display/Downloads/zForce+SDK+Downloads) and place in ext/ (e.g. ext/zForceSDK/zForce.h)

2. Invoke cmake

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```



### Bindings

Currently a C# binding has been created. No plans for other languages at this time and the API will more than likely change.
